<p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>Developed by Francisco Cirilla in the 1980s, a Pomodoro is a time-management technique</p> 
<p>that breaks up a task or multiple tasks into 25-minute chunks, spaced with five-minute breaks in-between</p>

<h1 id = "pomoh2">How do I use the Pomomatic?</h1>

<p>It's simple. First you fill out the pomolist, giving a brief description of each task</p>
<img id = "pomopic1" src = 'src/logo/name.png'></img>

<p>Then you set the timer</p>
<img id = "pomopic2" src = 'src/logo/settime.png'></img>

<p>Then you click the play button and get to work!</p>
<img id = "pomopic3" src = "src/logo/start.png" alt = "start"></img>
 

<h1 id = "pomoh3">What's with the Tomato?</h1>

<p>When developing the technique, Francisco used a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato.</p> 
<p>The italian word for tomato is "Pomodoro". Hence the name and the tomato icon</p>
